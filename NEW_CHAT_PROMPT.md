Hi! I need to continue working on my Link Station project. Here's the complete context:

## 🎯 Project Overview
**Link Station** - Real-time matching game web application
- **Live URL**: https://link-station-pro.vercel.app
- **Tech Stack**: React 19.1.1 + REST API + Vercel (migrated from Socket.IO)
- **Purpose**: Users join rooms, select each other, get matched in real-time

## 🏗️ Current Architecture
```
link-station/
├── index.html              # React app (served from root)
├── static/                 # CSS/JS assets
├── api/game.js            # Game API (serverless function)
├── client/                # React source code
└── vercel.json            # Vercel configuration
```

## ✅ Working Features
- **Multi-device room joining** with QR code sharing
- **Unique user identification** (prevents nickname conflicts)
- **Real-time selection process** (polling-based, 2-second intervals)
- **Synchronized match results** across all devices
- **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop

## 🔧 API Endpoints
- `POST /api/join` - Join room with nickname
- `POST /api/select` - Select another user for matching
- `GET /api/room/:roomId` - Get room status + match results

## 🐛 Major Issues Resolved
1. **404 errors** → Fixed static file serving
2. **Socket.IO compatibility** → Migrated to REST API + polling
3. **User conflicts** → Added unique display names (e.g., "박수형(1)")
4. **Match result broadcasting** → All devices see results via polling

## ✅ Recent Fixes Completed (Latest Session)
- ✅ **Notification timeout** - Success/error messages auto-hide after 3-5 seconds
- ✅ **Master kick feature** - Master can kick unwanted users with ✕ button
- ✅ **Voting status display** - Real-time showing of who voted vs waiting
- ✅ **Selection error debugging** - Enhanced error handling and logging for selection issues

## 📊 Current Status
- ✅ **Fully functional** - All core features working properly
- ✅ **Multi-device tested** - Real-time updates and synchronization working
- ✅ **Match results working** - Selection and results display correctly
- ✅ **Waiting room working** - Proper state management and user visibility

## 🎯 Potential Improvements
- Database integration (replace in-memory storage)
- User authentication system
- Game history and statistics
- Performance optimization

## 📝 Key Technical Details
- Uses polling (2s intervals) instead of WebSockets for real-time updates
- Static files served from root directory for Vercel compatibility
- Serverless functions handle API requests
- React app with QRCode.react for room sharing

## 🔧 Recent Debugging Added
- Debug panel in top-right corner showing state information
- Yellow debug box in waiting room showing host status
- Console logging for all state changes
- Detailed error tracking

## 🎯 Current Features Working
1. **Complete 8-state flow** - Enter → MakeRoom → EnterRoom → CheckPassword → EnterRoomWithQR → WaitingRoom → Linking → LinkResult
2. **Real-time updates** - Users see each other join and vote status updates
3. **Master controls** - Kick users, start games, manage room
4. **QR code sharing** - Proper routing to enterroomwithqr state
5. **Voting visualization** - See who voted vs who's waiting
6. **Auto-notifications** - Success/error messages with timeout

The project is fully functional and ready for production use!
