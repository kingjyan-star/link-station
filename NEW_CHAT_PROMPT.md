## üìã Project Quick Reference

**Name**: Link Station  
**Type**: Real-time matching game web application  
**Live URL**: https://link-station-pro.vercel.app  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Active Development - Recent State Flow Improvements

---

## ‚úÖ **RECENT IMPROVEMENTS - SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### **Session 13: State Flow Improvements** (October 2025)
- **Problem Solved**: Username persistence causing duplication errors
- **Solution**: 
  1. Added new `makeOrJoinRoom` bridge state
  2. Renamed states for clarity (enter ‚Üí registerName, etc.)
  3. Users now return to **WaitingRoom** after results (not name registration)
  4. Proper username cleanup with `/api/remove-user` endpoint
- **Benefits**:
  - ‚úÖ Users can play multiple rounds without re-entering nickname
  - ‚úÖ No more username duplication errors
  - ‚úÖ Clearer navigation flow

### **Session 12: Polling Bug** (October 2025) 
- **Problem Solved**: Only first voter saw results
- **Root Cause**: useEffect stopping polling on state transition
- **Solution**: Simplified polling logic, consolidated useEffect
- **Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - All users now see results properly

## üéØ What You Need to Know

I'm working on **Link Station**, a multi-device real-time matching game where users join rooms, select each other, and form pairs. The app has a 9-state flow from name registration to match results.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19.1.1 (client/src/App.js)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express API (api/game.js)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (serverless + static)
- **Real-time**: Polling-based updates (2-5 sec intervals)

### Current Architecture
- React app served from root (`index.html`, `static/`)
- API functions in `api/game.js` (serverless)
- No WebSockets (using REST + polling)
- In-memory storage (Map-based rooms)

---

## üìÅ Critical Files to Review

**MUST READ FIRST**:
1. **PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** - Complete development history, architecture, all bug fixes, and technical decisions

**Reference as Needed**:
2. **client/src/App.js** - Main React component (1109 lines, 8-state flow)
3. **api/game.js** - Serverless API with all endpoints
4. **client/src/App.css** - Complete styling
5. **vercel.json** - Deployment configuration

---

## üéÆ 9-State Flow Overview (Updated)

1. **RegisterName** (formerly Enter) - Username registration only
2. **MakeOrJoinRoom** (NEW) - Bridge state: choose make/join/exit
3. **MakeRoom** - Create room with name, password, member limit
4. **JoinRoom** (formerly EnterRoom) - Join room by name
5. **CheckPassword** - Password verification for protected rooms
6. **JoinRoomWithQR** (formerly EnterroomwithQR) - Join via QR code
7. **WaitingRoom** - Pre-game lobby with master controls
8. **Linking** - Active matching/voting phase
9. **LinkResult** - Display match results (now returns to WaitingRoom)

---

## üîß Key API Endpoints

**Room Management**:
- `POST /api/create-room` - Create room (assigns master)
- `POST /api/join-room` - Join room
- `POST /api/join-room-qr` - Join via QR (bypasses password)
- `POST /api/kick-user` - Master removes user

**Game Flow**:
- `POST /api/start-game` - Master starts game (locks room)
- `POST /api/select` - User votes (auto-processes when all vote)
- `GET /api/room/:roomId` - Get room status (polling)
- `POST /api/ping` - Heartbeat to keep connection alive
- `POST /api/remove-user` - Clean up username on exit

---

## ‚úÖ Latest Status (October 2025)

### What's Working
- ‚úÖ Complete 8-state flow
- ‚úÖ Room creation and joining
- ‚úÖ Master controls (kick, start game)
- ‚úÖ QR code sharing with proper routing
- ‚úÖ Auto-hiding notifications (3s success, 5s error)
- ‚úÖ Room name duplication prevention
- ‚úÖ User disconnect detection and cleanup
- ‚úÖ Enhanced UI with 3-space indicators (Master, Selection, Voting Status)

### Current Critical Bugs
- ‚ùå **No results shown to anybody after voting**
- ‚ùå **Users cannot see others' vote status except when they vote**
- ‚ùå **Master also affected by vote status update issues**
- ‚ùå **Polling system fundamentally broken despite multiple fixes**

### Recent Fix Attempts (October 2025)
1. **Room Duplication** - Fixed case-insensitive room name checking
2. **Connection Management** - Added heartbeat system and user cleanup
3. **Voting Status** - Multiple attempts to fix real-time voting status display
4. **API Logging** - Added comprehensive debugging logs
5. **Polling Architecture** - Multiple comprehensive fixes attempted
6. **Result Broadcasting** - Enhanced result detection with multiple fallbacks

### Known Limitations
- In-memory storage (data lost on server restart)
- Polling creates traffic overhead
- No persistent game history
- No user authentication

## üöÄ Deployment Process

**Standard Build & Deploy**:
```bash
# 1. Build React app
cd client && npm run build && cd ..

# 2. Copy static files (Windows)
copy client\build\index.html index.html
xcopy client\build\static static /E /I /Y

# 3. Deploy
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
git push origin main
```

Vercel auto-deploys on push to main branch.

## üêõ Current Critical Issues (Requires Fundamental Fix)

**Problem**: Polling system is fundamentally broken despite multiple comprehensive fixes

**Evidence**:
- Multiple fix attempts have been made with no success
- Issues persist across all users (including master)
- Real-time updates completely non-functional
- Results never shown to any user

**Investigation Needed**:
1. **Fundamental polling architecture review** - Current approach may be fundamentally flawed
2. **Alternative real-time solutions** - Consider WebSockets or Server-Sent Events
3. **Simplified state management** - Current state management may be too complex
4. **API response structure** - May need to redesign how data is returned

---

## üí° Development Context

### Why This Architecture?
- **No WebSockets**: Vercel serverless doesn't support persistent connections
- **Polling**: Provides near real-time experience (2-5 sec updates)
- **Static Root**: Simplifies Vercel deployment and CDN serving
- **In-Memory Storage**: Sufficient for session-based games

### Common Debug Points
- Check browser console for polling responses
- Verify `gameState` transitions (waiting ‚Üí linking ‚Üí completed)
- Ensure `hasVoted` field updates correctly
- Confirm `matchResult` in `/api/room/:roomId` response

### State Management
- Each state has dedicated render function in `App.js`
- Polling runs differently in waiting (5s) vs linking (2s)
- Master status (`isMaster`) propagated to ALL users via API
- Kicked user detection via polling (checks if userId still in room.users)

---

## üîç Troubleshooting Guide

### If polling doesn't work at all:
1. Check if `pollingInterval.current` is not null
2. Verify `currentState` is correct for polling
3. Check for JavaScript errors in console
4. Ensure API endpoints are responding correctly

### If users don't see results:
1. Check if polling is running on all devices
2. Verify `gameState` changes to 'completed' in API
3. Ensure `matchResult` is returned in `/api/room/:roomId`
4. Check if results are being detected by polling logic

### If vote status doesn't update:
1. Check if polling is active during voting phase
2. Verify API returns correct `hasVoted` status
3. Ensure frontend updates `users` state with new data
4. Check if UI is re-rendering with updated state

## üìö How to Use This Context

1. **Read PROJECT_CONTEXT.md first** - It has everything (50+ sections, complete history)
2. **Check current files** - Review App.js and api/game.js for latest code
3. **Understand polling** - Most real-time features work via polling
4. **Test multi-device** - Always verify on 2+ devices for synchronization

---

## üéØ Your First Steps

When starting a new session:

1. **Analyze the fundamental polling architecture** - Current approach may be fundamentally flawed
2. **Consider alternative real-time solutions** - WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, or different polling approach
3. **Simplify the state management** - Current complexity may be causing issues
4. **Test with minimal implementation** - Start with basic polling and build up
