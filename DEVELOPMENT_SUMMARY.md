# 🔗 Link Station Application - Development Summary

## 📋 Project Overview

**Link Station** is a real-time matching game web application where users join rooms and select each other to form pairs. It's designed for 3:3 or 4:4 matching scenarios with QR code sharing functionality.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 19.1.1** - Main UI framework
- **QRCode.react** - QR code generation for room sharing
- **CSS3** - Styling with gradient backgrounds and responsive design

### Backend
- **Node.js** - Server runtime
- **Express.js** - Web framework
- **REST API** - Game logic and room management

### Deployment
- **Vercel** - Hosting platform
- **Serverless Functions** - API endpoints
- **Static Site** - React build served from root directory

## 🎮 Core Features

### 1. Room Management
- Users can join rooms with custom nicknames
- Unique room IDs for each game session
- QR code generation for easy room sharing
- Automatic unique display names for duplicate nicknames (e.g., "박수형(1)")

### 2. Real-time Matching Game
- Users select other participants in the room
- Mutual selection creates successful matches
- Automatic match processing when all users have selected
- Results display showing successful matches and unmatched users

### 3. Multi-device Support
- Works across multiple devices (computer, phones)
- Synchronized game state across all devices
- Polling-based updates (2-second intervals) for real-time feel

## 🚀 Deployment Architecture

### File Structure
```
link-station/
├── index.html              # Main React app (served from root)
├── static/                 # CSS and JS assets
│   ├── css/
│   └── js/
├── api/
│   └── game.js            # Game API serverless function
├── client/                # React source code
│   ├── src/
│   └── build/
├── server.js              # Original Socket.IO server (unused)
└── vercel.json            # Vercel configuration
```

### Vercel Configuration
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "**/*",
      "use": "@vercel/static"
    },
    {
      "src": "api/game.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/(.*)",
      "destination": "/api/game.js"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### POST /api/join
- **Purpose**: Join a room with a nickname
- **Body**: `{ roomId, nickname }`
- **Response**: `{ success, userId, users[] }`
- **Features**: Automatic unique display name generation

### POST /api/select
- **Purpose**: Select another user for matching
- **Body**: `{ roomId, userId, selectedUserId }`
- **Response**: `{ success, matches[], unmatched[], users[] }`
- **Features**: Automatic match processing when all users have selected

### GET /api/room/:roomId
- **Purpose**: Get current room status and match results
- **Response**: `{ success, room: { users, selections }, matchResult }`
- **Features**: Includes match results for polling-based updates

## 🐛 Major Issues Resolved

### 1. Vercel Deployment Issues
**Problem**: 404 errors for static files, blank page
**Root Cause**: Incorrect file paths and Vercel configuration
**Solution**: 
- Moved React build files to root directory
- Fixed vercel.json routing
- Used `@vercel/static` for static files

### 2. Socket.IO Compatibility
**Problem**: Socket.IO doesn't work with Vercel serverless functions
**Root Cause**: WebSocket limitations in serverless environment
**Solution**: 
- Replaced Socket.IO with REST API
- Implemented polling-based updates (2-second intervals)
- Created serverless API functions

### 3. User Nickname Conflicts
**Problem**: Multiple devices with same nickname overwrote each other
**Root Cause**: Frontend state management issues
**Solution**: 
- Added unique display names in API
- Fixed React state handling
- Improved user identification

### 4. Match Result Broadcasting
**Problem**: Only the device that made the selection saw match results
**Root Cause**: No mechanism to notify all devices of match completion
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced room status API to include match results
- Updated polling logic to check for and display results
- Synchronized match display across all devices

## 📱 User Experience Flow

1. **Login Screen**: User enters nickname and room ID
2. **Room Joining**: User joins room, sees other participants
3. **QR Code Sharing**: Generate QR code to invite others
4. **Selection Phase**: Users select their preferred partners
5. **Match Results**: All devices see results simultaneously
6. **New Game**: Option to start a new game

## 🎯 Key Technical Decisions

### Why API Instead of Socket.IO?
- Vercel serverless functions don't support persistent WebSocket connections
- REST API with polling provides similar real-time experience
- More reliable deployment and scaling

### Why Static Files in Root?
- Vercel auto-detection works better with standard structure
- Simpler routing configuration
- Avoids complex path resolution issues

### Why Polling Instead of Push?
- Serverless functions can't maintain persistent connections
- 2-second polling provides near real-time experience
- Reliable and works across all devices

## 🔮 Future Improvements

1. **Database Integration**: Replace in-memory storage with persistent database
2. **User Authentication**: Add user accounts and game history
3. **Advanced Matching**: Implement more sophisticated matching algorithms
4. **Real-time Notifications**: Add push notifications for better UX
5. **Mobile App**: Create native mobile applications

## 📊 Current Status (Updated - Latest Session - ALL ISSUES RESOLVED)

✅ **Fully Functional**: Complete 8-state flow working perfectly
✅ **Waiting Room Working**: Players see proper waiting room with real-time updates
✅ **Host Detection Working**: Master badge visible, "게임 시작" button functional
✅ **Match Results Working**: Selections work and results display correctly
✅ **State Management Fixed**: Proper polling and state transitions

## ✅ Issues Resolved (Latest Session)

### 1. Notification Timeout ✅
- **Problem**: Success/error notifications never disappeared
- **Solution**: Added auto-hide timers (3s for success, 5s for errors)
- **Result**: Clean UI with temporary notifications

### 2. Master Kick Feature ✅
- **Problem**: No way for master to remove unwanted users
- **Solution**: Added kick button (✕) for master with API endpoint
- **Result**: Master can manage room participants

### 3. Voting Status Display ✅
- **Problem**: Users couldn't see who voted vs who's waiting
- **Solution**: Added "투표완료" and "대기중" badges with real-time updates
- **Result**: Clear visibility of voting progress

### 4. Selection Error Debugging ✅
- **Problem**: "선택 중 오류가 발생했습니다" error on 3rd user selection
- **Solution**: Enhanced API validation and error logging
- **Result**: Better error handling and debugging information

## 🔧 Current Features Working
- **Complete 8-state flow** with proper transitions
- **Real-time updates** via polling (2-second intervals)
- **Master controls** (kick users, start games)
- **QR code sharing** with proper routing
- **Voting visualization** with status badges
- **Auto-notifications** with timeout
- **Password-protected rooms**
- **Member limit enforcement**
- **Username duplication prevention**
